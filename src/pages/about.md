This Astro boilerplate contains layouts, components, and extensions that provide essential features for most websites.

The CSS has been kept separate to the components to make it easier to replace entirely. The HTML is semantic, so applying drastically different styles and layouts should be easy enough.

You can publish Astro sites to [GitHub pages](/about/github-pages/). Alternatively, you can run `npm run build` and push the `/dist/` folder to your preferred hosting infrastructure.
