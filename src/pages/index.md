I'm experimenting with Jekyll and Astro. This is the Astro version, there is also a [Jekyll version](https://jekyll.stevefenton.co.uk/).

Welcome to Astro Boilerplate. A super-lightweight, accessible, SEO friendly starter project for the [Astro](https://astro.build/).

:::div{.note}
The Astro Boilerplate source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/astro-boilerplate).

Astro Boilerplate is built on some strong opinions:

- Accessibility is not just important, it's fundamental
- Everything should still work without JavaScript
- The democratising force in the World Wide Web is HTML files
- Software supply chains should be minimal

> Astro is the first framework build on the *majestic HTML* concept, where pages can be largely static but still enhanced with additional stateful behaviour where needed.
>
> It's clean semantic HTML, simple CSS, and some minor non-essential enhancements in plain JavaScript. <cite>Steve Fenton</cite>

Out of the box, Astro Boilerplate is a "top scores" high-performance website in the Pagespeed lab. [Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about?hl=en-US) tests website performance on mobile and desktop across a number of measurements.

Test scores aren't everything, but Astro Boilerplate is light and fast.
