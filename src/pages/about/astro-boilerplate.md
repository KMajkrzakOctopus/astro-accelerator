Astro Boilerplate contains some Astro components and Markdown extensions. These provide essential features that are needed by most sites.

You can adjust the existing theme by changing the CSS variables, or use it as the starting point for your own bespoke design.

The customised elements include:

- [Custom front-matter](/about/front-matter/) to power navigation features
- A number of Astro components

You can use an action to push your site to [GitHub Pages](/about/github-pages/).
