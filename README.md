# Asro Boilerplate

## TODO

- How to make Astro run as a sub-folder. For example the site running via Azure Front Door as www.example.com/news/
- Markdown extension for `:::note`
- Markdown for `{:loading=lazy}`
- Remaining items in `head.Head.astro`
- Breadcrumbs.asto
- Search feature
- JavaScript (and move it to relevant components)
